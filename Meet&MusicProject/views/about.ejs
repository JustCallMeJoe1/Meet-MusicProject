            Music & Meet was established in 2008 after its founder wanted to create a platform where like minded music lovers could connect. Around 2008, the music scene was begining to integrate technology into everday life more often. With the rise of mobile technology, more people were able to connect in an easier fashion. By using the power of technology, we look to connect people with music. The founder though creating a platform would assist in this vision. The founder wanted to create a safe and productive enviormnent that promoted music events to concert goers.

            This platform would provide a way to allow users to connect with each other and RSVP to certain music events. At these events the platform would act as a communication medium for music lovers to meet up at the event. The platform also provided a way to see what kind of music events were occuring in a user's immediate area. By browsing the platform, users can see the different kinds of music events that are occuring within their area. By being able to view these different events, users would be able to explore new types of music by RSVPing to these specific events in the area. This platform also works closely with music organizers to provide exposure to lesser known bands in user's areas. By working closely with our partners, we can bring people together with the power of music!
